We achieve the BiG goals and extend the impacts from research, teaching, outreach, entrepreneurship and collaboration.\nOur Current research topics include: bio-inspired self-burrowing robots, bio-inspired underground sensing and communication, bio-inspired sustainable countermeasures to natural hazards.\n\n# Professional Membership\n\n\n\n\\begin{longtable}{p{1.5in}p{6in}}\n  Associate Member & American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Geo-Institute \\\\ \n  Member & International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (ISSMGE) \\\\ \n  Member & Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) \\\\ \n  Member & Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) \\\\ \n  Member & International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) \\\\ \n  Member & Transportation Research Board (TRB) \\\\ \n  \\end{longtable}\n\n\n\n\\vspace{1.5em}\n\n\\part*{\\uppercase{Publications, Intellectual Property and Invited Talks}}\n\nSince 2009, I have authored **115** research publications, including **44** journal papers, **66** conference papers, and **5** technical reports, co-edited **3** books, and filed **2** patents.\nI also have delivered **36** invited talks to universities, local, national and international conferences.\nAs of **November  4, 2024**, my h-index is **19** and i10-index is **34**, with total citations of **1,654**. **Only publications on bio-inspired geotechnics are included below.**\n\n# Journal Articles on Bio-inspired Geotechnics [^1]\n\n[^1]: **Bold**: PhD student, \\underline{Underline}: MS student,  ^#^: undergrad student, $^\\infty$: visiting student, $^\\times$: PostDoc, ^\\*^: corresponding\n\n\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{33ya3} \\nocite{5kbf6} \\nocite{64jy2} \\nocite{7hu8d} \\nocite{ddeay} \\nocite{dn7hp} \\nocite{e3c8c} \\nocite{jq4fd} \\nocite{lgxhz} \\nocite{lqd52} \\nocite{r2vrf} \\nocite{r53ba} \\nocite{tf1kq} \\nocite{we510} \\nocite{wknyx} \\nocite{xpzod} \\nocite{zfnsh} \\nocite{zlsbn}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n\n\n# Editorial or Opinion Articles on Bio-inspired Geotechnics\n\n\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{aa2bh} \\nocite{uowq1}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n\n\n# Conference Papers on Bio-inspired Geotechnics [^2]\n\n[^2]: **Bold**: PhD student, \\underline{Underline}: MS student,  ^#^: undergrad student, $^\\infty$: visiting student, $^\\times$: PostDoc, ^\\*^: corresponding, $^\\sim$: presentor\n\n\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{1sgt2} \\nocite{23fg3} \\nocite{4h7su} \\nocite{agfqq} \\nocite{bley0} \\nocite{ctwwi} \\nocite{f2kxo} \\nocite{f5ir4} \\nocite{f8fgf} \\nocite{ifjl5} \\nocite{ivd5k} \\nocite{kjm39} \\nocite{ldasx} \\nocite{og6gr} \\nocite{ojg8u} \\nocite{ok3xf} \\nocite{orggm} \\nocite{p4c8b} \\nocite{pe59j} \\nocite{r8rau} \\nocite{rxo2c} \\nocite{vt59k} \\nocite{wrrx5} \\nocite{xkx8f} \\nocite{ztjv3}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n\n\n# Patents on Bio-inspired Geotechnics\n\n\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{i5a2w} \\nocite{xkyhi}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n\n\n\\vspace{1.5em}\n\n\\part*{\\uppercase{Professional activities and service}}\n\nI served as an Editor or Guest Editor for **3** peer-reviewed journals or journal special issues and currently serving on an Editorial Board for **1** journal.
