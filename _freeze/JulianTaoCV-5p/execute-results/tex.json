We achieve the BiG goals and extend the impacts from research, teaching, outreach, entrepreneurship and collaboration.\nOur Current research topics include: bio-inspired self-burrowing robots, bio-inspired underground sensing and communication, bio-inspired sustainable countermeasures to natural hazards.\n\n# Professional Membership\n\n\n\n\\begin{longtable}{p{1.5in}p{6in}}\n  Associate Member & American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Geo-Institute \\\\ \n  Member & International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (ISSMGE) \\\\ \n  Member & Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) \\\\ \n  Member & Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) \\\\ \n  Member & International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) \\\\ \n  Member & Transportation Research Board (TRB) \\\\ \n  \\end{longtable}\n\n\n\n\\vspace{1.5em}\n\n\\part*{\\uppercase{Publications, Intellectual Property and Invited Talks}}\n\nSince 2009, I have authored **115** research publications, including **44** journal papers, **66** conference papers, and **5** technical reports, co-edited **3** books, and filed **2** patents.\nI also have delivered **34** invited talks to universities, local, national and international conferences.\nAs of **August  9, 2024**, my h-index is **18** and i10-index is **34**, with total citations of **1,576**.
